# MapleList
MapleList is a simple web application which includes pre set categories for the most common dailies and weeklies. Users can also
set their own categories and add tasks to do within those (still a work in progress). The intention is to have have the app
ran on a server, but for now you can simply clone the repository (or download all files) and simply open the `index.html` file.
